  <h2> The Archbishop's homily on how to become saints </h2>
	<body>
      In his homily today, the archbishop was telling us how to become saints. He said that contrary to what we might think, it’s not necessarily through the strength of our will to do so, but the strength of our will to let God do so. He gave us a metaphor (originally from St. Paul, I think) describing a sculptor carving into a block of stone. If we are the block of stone, and God the sculptor, then you might imagine that it wouldn’t be pleasant to have a chunk of ourselves removed. This is especially true when we struggle to see the final result God has in mind. So, we must have strong wills to continue to let God do his work on us. As St. Teresa of Calcutta said, we must give what God takes and take what he gives with a big smile.
