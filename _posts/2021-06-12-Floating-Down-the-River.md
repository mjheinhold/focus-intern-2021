# Floating Down the River
> Yes, this is *that* floating trip.
John, the missionary staying in the Fulton's upstairs apartment, and David, his old friend and now teammate, invited the interns to go floating with them. It turned out to be much more of an adventure than any of us bargained for.
After we arrived, and nearly passed out inflating our tubes, we began to get into the river. To our surprise, and dismay, the water was a refreshing ~30 degrees, and our legs were bright red in a matter of minutes. We decided we were committed, having driven an hour to get there, and hopped in the freezing river. About 15 minutes later, we decided to "wait a bit" and see if the water would get warmer. We ate the lunches that we had packed and played a game or two. Then, we decided to give the water another go and try again. (It was at this point, getting back into the river, that I realized I no longer had my phone and that it was likely long gone in the strong undercurrent, with no cell servie to check.)
It was not, in fact, any warmer, but at this point we decided we would make the most of it. Rocks, branches, and other tubers served as needed distractions as we navigated our tubes down the river. Truly, it was a bonding experience if nothing else.
After a few hours, bruised backs, and popped tubes later, we made it to our endpoint and celebrated with shouts of joy. When asked about the trip later that week, the most common response was "Well, it was an adventure" :)
