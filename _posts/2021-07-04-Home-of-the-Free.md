Happy Fourth! While I did not get to see any fireworks this year (they're heavily regulated in CO because of forest fires), I did have a pretty amazing day. The Fultons invited us to join in their tradition, which includes a Stations of the Cross hike and outdoor mass at their friends the Amen's ranch. It was a hot day, and in total the hike was about 400 feet in elevation. I can confidently say I've never been so out of breath when praying through the Stations. But it was an awesome experience nonetheless. As we hiked, I was able to meditate on a few things. I felt more connected to Jesus' own suffering on his journey to his crucifixtion. I was only carrying a book and a water bottle, and yet I was looking for shade and rest at every opportunity. Jesus was able to carry his cross, having already been beaten, without a single complaint. Second, since it is indeed the Fourth of July, I reflected on the amazing fact that I could partake in something like this. There are still so many Catholics around the world that are being persecuted for their faith, killed as they try to celebrate Mass. It made me want to never take something like this for granted again. Lastly, as we reached the top of the mountain where the last station was, I had to stop and simply admire God's creation. It's something I really haven't stopped doing since arriving here, but it still feels necessary to do in places like that.
I continued to admire His creation even after the hike, as we celebrated Mass outdoors. There is something truly beautiful about singing hymns and hearing the Word while still in nature. After Mass, we stayed for a while and enjoyed lunch. It was so nice to see so many different families together. We were able to eat and enjoy each other's company for a while before it started to rain (and hail!). Praise God that it held off long enough for everyone to still enjoy the day. Overall, I feel blessed to have been able to spend my Fourth like I did.
