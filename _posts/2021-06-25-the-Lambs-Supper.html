  <h2> Scott Hahn's The Lamb's Supper </h2>
	<body>
    I finished Scott Hahn’s book The Lamb’s Supper yesterday, a book about what’s really happening every time we celebrate Mass. While it didn’t make me fall down in awe during Mass today (although maybe it should’ve), it did make me think. Specifically, I’ve been reflecting on the Sign of the Cross as a symbol of my inheritance, my salvation, as well as the banner I bear into battle with the devil. It’s made me think about the things in my faith that I’ve taken for granted and never tried to learn more about. It’s made me want to ask “why” behind so much of our Catholic Tradition, because it’s just so rich.
